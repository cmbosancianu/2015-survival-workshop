# Event History Analysis with `R`

The repository contains teaching materials from a 2015 workshop in survival analysis at the University of Heidelberg, organized at the request of [Prof. Dr. Jale Tosun](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/personal/tosun/person/). Over the 2 days, sessions focused on:

1. Basic concepts in survival analysis: *survivor* and *hazard* functions, censoring, and a risk set;
2. Descriptive analyses: Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test
3. The Cox *proportional hazards* model
4. Extensions to the Cox PH model: *stratified* and *extended* specifications

The main theoretical source for the sessions was Kleinbaum, D. G., & Klein, M. (2012). *Survival Analysis: A Self-Learning Text*. New York, NY: Springer.
